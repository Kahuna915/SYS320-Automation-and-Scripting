Do you see anything of concern with the attempts to obtain a shell?  Provide a brief explanation.
Well if someone obtains a shell they can run powerful scripts and inject malicious material into the system.

What did you like the most and least about this assignment?
most - Made me research a ton and actually understand the code deeper
least - yamal file on windows kept giving me errors.

---
What additional questions do you have?
I had a hard time getting the code to work. It was able to print all the contents of the files line by line.
But I kept getting an unhashable type "dict" error that I could not resolve. I would like to meet and see how to resolve this error
as it seems if that gets solved the code would work.
Also the yamal file kept giving me errors and I had to hash mutiple lines out to be able to test.
